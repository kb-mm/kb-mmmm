                    <p>Recently, there has been growing interest in combining knowledge bases and multiple modalities such as NLP, vision and speech. These combinations have resulted in improvements to various downstream tasks including question answering, image classification, object detection, and link prediction. The objectives of the KBMM workshop is to bring together researchers interested in (a) combining knowledge bases with other modalities to showcase more effective downstream tasks, (b) improving completion and construction of knowledge bases from multiple modalities, and in general, to share state-of-the-art approaches, best practices, and future directions.

The workshop will consist of contributed posters, and invited talks on a wide variety of methods and problems in this area. We invite paper submissions in the following categories to present at the workshop:

Knowledge base completion using multiple modalities 
Using knowledge bases in NLP tasks
Vision and knowledge bases
Information extraction
Optimization challenges in multimodal scenarios
Benchmark datasets and evaluation methods

Introduction to the workshop: 30 min
Speaker I: 45 minutes (Vision)
Speaker II: 45 minutes (NLP)
Break: 30 min
